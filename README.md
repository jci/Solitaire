Solitaire
=========

My own rendition of solitaire being done like a madman

Personal message:

// ME FROM THE FUTURE:

// THIS IS ME FROM THE PAST. PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

// I TRIED HARD BUT I AM WAY TO STUPID TO FIGURE OUT 

// SOMETHING SO SIMPLE. AS DRAG&DROP WITHOUT THIS KINDA HACK

// SINCERELY,

// ME FROM THE PAST.


This is a purely "simplistic" approach to make the solitaire game as I wanted.
It's a mess. Feel free to correct it.

You can do pretty much everything you want with this code. I forbid you to use it, but what the hell...

If you want to create a commercial game with this code, just buy me a beer. Although, please don't use the deck of cards I used here. Can't tell where I got it so license may be blurry on this.
